            <h3>Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821 - 1881)</h3>
            <p>
              Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky is one of the most important
              Russian novelists of the 19th century. In his works, he delved
              into the depths of the human soul and conveyed the inner conflicts
              of the individual, moral and philosophical problems in a literary
              language. Dostoevsky, who started his writing career at a young
              age, led a difficult life. His years of exile in Siberia and his
              experiences there left deep traces in his works.
            </p>
            <p>
              His works include novels such as ‘Crime and Punishment’, ‘The
              Idiot’, ‘The Brothers Karamazov’ and ‘Notes from Underground’,
              which are considered masterpieces of world literature. In these
              works, he deals with deep philosophical themes such as moral
              questions, the complex psychological structure of man and the
              belief in God. Dostoevsky is considered to be one of the writers
              who best describes the complexity of the human soul in the world
              of literature.

            <h3>Major Works</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Crime and Punishment</li>
              <p>
                The psychological and moral conflicts that Raskolnikov
                experiences after the murder he commits constitute the main
                theme of this novel.
              </p>
              <li>The Idiot</li>
              <p>
                Prince Mishkin's naivety and good-heartedness define him as a
                ‘fool’ in society. This novel offers a profound examination of
                goodness and purity.
              </p>
              <li>The Brothers Karamazov</li>
              <p>
                The hatred of the three brothers against their father and their
                inner conflicts constitute the main axis of the novel. This work
                is one of Dostoevsky's most complex and philosophical novels.
              </p>
              <li>Notes from Underground</li>
              <p>
                This short novel, which contains the inner monologues of a man
                isolated from society, is considered one of the most important
                texts of modern literature.
